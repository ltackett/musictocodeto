MTCT is a CLI-like interface for SoundCloud written in React.
Check it out at [musictocodeto.com](http://musictocodeto.com)

### Running MTCT locally

Assuming you've got Node and Yarn installed, just install the modules and run the server:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

You will also need to add your own soundcloud API key to the local environment variables.

#### `.env.local`

```REACT_APP_SOUNDCLOUD_API_KEY=abc123xyz789```

### Purpose of MTCT

This is my playground project. Every few years I firepurge the codebase and start over.

The goal here is twofold:

1. To iteratively document how I have grown in my approach to solving the same set of problems.
1. To try out new and emergent technologies, and git gud.
