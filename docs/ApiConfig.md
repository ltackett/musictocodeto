# Switching to a real API

Chances are, once you get comfortable with this setup, you'll want to hook into some existing API rather than use the simple one that comes with this project. Here's how:

## Update `package.json`

First things first, you need to add `APIHOST` settings in `package.json`. If you look in `src/config.js`, you'll see that it's already configured to read this `APIHOST` setting if it's present.

If the port you use differs between your dev & prod API hosts, you may want to get rid of the `APIPORT` setting, including it right in `APIHOST`. Same with the protocol â€“ if you use HTTP in dev but HTTPS in prod, you may want to include the protocol right in `APIHOST`, and then get rid of the explicit `"http://"` found in the next section.

## Update `ApiClient`

Open up `src/helpers/ApiClient.js`. You'll see this line:

``` javascript
   if (__SERVER__) {
     // Prepend host and port of the API server to the path.
    return 'http://' + config.apiHost + adjustedPath;
   }
```

If you added `http://` or `https://` to your APIHOST setting, then you need to remove it here.

In this file, you'll also see that there's a `/api` that gets prepended to the URL when on the client side. That gets routed through a proxy that's configured in server.js, which we'll get to next.

Why do you need a proxy? So that the `APIHOST` can be set as part of the Node environment, and your client side code can still work. A user's browser doesn't have access to your server's Node environment, so instead the client-side code makes all API calls to this `/api` proxy, which the server configures to hit your real API. That way you can control everything sanely, through environment variables, and set different API endpoints for your different environments.

## Update `server.js`

To update the proxy, find this chunk in `src/server.js`:

``` javascript
  const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({
    target: 'http://' + config.apiHost,
    ws: true
  });
```

You'll want to change this in a few ways:

### 1. Update `target` protocol

If you changed APIHOST to include the `http://` or `https://` protocol, then get rid of the `'http://' +` in the `target` setting. Note that you'll need to restart your server after making these changes or things will break.

### 2. Decide if you need WebSockets

The `ws: true` setting is there to support WebSockets connections, which this demo app supports using [socket.io](http://socket.io/). If your API doesn't use WebSockets, then you can remove this line.

### 3. Add a `changeOrigin` setting

This might be the most important part! It's possible that your API lives at a totally different URL than your front-end app. If that's the case, then you need to add a `changeOrigin` setting. 

Here's an example of what the final chunk of code might look like:

``` javascript
  const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer({
    target: config.apiHost,
    changeOrigin: true
  });
```

Finally, after doing all of that, you can get rid of the demo API.

## Get rid of stuff

You can remove the whole `api` folder, as well as `bin/api.js`.

Once you do that, you'll also need to remove the lines in `package.json` that called those things. Remove all this:

* ` \"npm run start-prod-api\"` from the `start` script command
* ` \"npm run start-dev-api\"` from the `dev` script command
* the `start-prod-api` and `start-dev-api` scripts altogether
* the ` api` argument from the `lint` script
* the `test-node` and `test-node-watch` scripts, which were there to test the demo API
* the `start-prod-api` and `start-dev-api` settings in the `betterScripts` section

If you want, you can also remove all references to `socket`, if you're not using it.
